        <h3>Powershell to UCS Director Cloupia Script converter for use with UCS Director Custom Workflow Tasks</h3>
        <p>
            UCS Director contains a tool for calling Powershell through a "Powershell Agent". For extremely simple tasks
            this tool is suitable. But for more advanced tasks which require better handling of input and output data as well
            as error management, the prebuilt task for executing Powershell scripts within the Windows infrastructure,
            Cloupiascript is better suited.
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is work in progress and extends Powershell through comments placed at the top of a Powershell
            script to permit the developer to have a single file that can be used for generating all the code necessary
            to execute Powershell on UCS Director and map input and output variables from the "custom workflow task" 
            declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
            By specially coding comments at the start of a script, there are three classes of values that can be defined.
            <ul>
                <li>Input variables passed as part of the UCSD <i>input</i> structure as members</li>
                <li>Output variables to be returned by Powershell and mapped to UCSD <i>output</i> class member variables</li>
                <li>Variable substitutions to be used to invoke the Powershell script such as what machine to run the script on.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the following as an example :
<pre>##{
### Execute Powershell Options
##    SubtaskLabel = "Create Machine Name"
##    PowershellAgent = "Development"
##    TargetIP = "1.2.3.4"
##    Username = "Administrator"
##    Password = "MaryHadALittleLambForDinner"
##    Domain = "MyAwesomeWindowsDomain"
### Inputs
##    optimizedApplicationName -> OptimizedApplicationName
##    siteName -> SiteName
##    domain -> Domain
##    adJoinAccount -> ADJoinAccount
##    zone -> Zone
##    subZone -> Subzone
### Outputs
##    machineName <- MachineName
##}</pre>
            This language is line oriented and therefore does not allow wrapping to new lines.
        </p>
        <h4>Comments</h4>
        <p>
            Comments are any text which starts with three hash signs "###". They extend to the end of the line 
            and are purely informative and are otherwise ignored.
        </p>
        <h4>Variables/Macros</h4>
        <p>
            Variables are used for substitution within the boiler plate code for producing the output Cloupiascript.
            Variables are formated as : <br/>
        </p>
        <blockquote>## <i>Name</i> = <i>Value</i></blockquote>
        <p>
            <b>Name</b> is a literal, this is simply a string of text starting with a letter or underscore (_) and followed
            by zero or more letters, numbers or underscores. The name is compared (case sensitive) to substitution macros in
            the boiler plate and the value is placed there.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Value</b> can be formatted in two ways. 
            <ul>
                <li>The first is encapsulated within double-quotes "". In this circumstance
                    the resulting subtitution would substitute the value explicitly as written.</li>
                <li>The second method allows UCSD Custom workflow task input values to be used. In this case
                    the name of the input value is provided without quotes and the name is interpretted as meaning
                    a member of the <i>input</i> class passed by UCSD to the Cloupiascript.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Input variables</h4>
        <p>
            Input variables are variables passed from the UCS Director <i>input</i> class into the Powershell 
            <i>$inputs</i> structure to be employed by the provided script. The format of an input variable is 
            as follows :
        </p>
        <blockquote>## <i>CloupiascriptName</i> -> <i>PowershellName</i></blockquote>
        <p>
            As you can see, the direction of the arrow is referring to the copying from the Cloupiascript variable
            into the Powershell script variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Input variables are stored in a Powershell structure that in this circumstance would look like :
        </p>
<pre>
$inputs = @{
    OptimizedApplicationName = 'PUPPY'
    SiteName = 'USA'
    Domain = 'ENG'
    ADJoinAccount = 'Awesome@user.com'
    Zone = 'Here'
    Subzone = 'CN=poochie,DC=woochie,DC=puddin,DC=pie'
}</pre>
        <p>
            The input variables are copied in the Cloupiascript from the <i>input</i> class verbatim.
        </p>
        <h4>Output variables</h4>
        <p>
            Output variables provide mappings from Powershell return values that have been specially formatted into
            the Cloupiascript <i>output</i> class. These values are single values, not arrays.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the responsibility of the script writer to properly format a return structure called <i>$outputs</i>
            to be processed upon return.
        </p>
        <p>
            The header definition for defining the relation ship is as follows :
        </p>
        <blockquote>## <i>CloupiascriptName</i> <- <i>PowershellName</i></blockquote>
        <p>
            As with input variables, the direction of the arror defines the direction for the data to be copied. The
            directive as above expressly specifies that the values will be extracted from the returned <i>$outputs</i>
            structure into the Cloupiascript <i>output</i> structure.
        </p>
        <h4>Format of return structure from Powershell</h4>
<pre>
$result = @{
    'success' = $true
    'outputs' = @{
        'MachineName' = 'GoodieGoodie'
    }
    'error' = ''
    'log' = ''
}
return $result
</pre>
        <p>
            The result structure must be formatted precisely as seen above. There are four mandatory values to be
            included.
            <ul>
                <li><i>success</i> - specifies whether the Powershell script succeeded.</li>
                <li><i>error</i> - provides a means for Powershell to return a meaningful error message back to 
                    UCS Director when something goes wrong. Even if there is no error, it is important
                    to define this value as non-null.</li>
                <li><i>log</i> - Provides a method of returning a meaningful log message from Powershell. 
                    As with <i>error</i> it is important to ensure that this is a non-null value even if
                    unused.</li>
                <li><i>outputs</i> - Provides the return values that have been defined in the headers to be
                    mapped to the Cloupiascript/UCS Director <i>output</i> structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
